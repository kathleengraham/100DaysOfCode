### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my new Tribute Page. I was able to complete the following:
* update the organization using Bootstrap classes more efficiently.
* renaming h4 elements so that they break down sections more clearly to the reader.

#### **Thoughts:**

I had submitted another one for freeCodeCamp in the past, but I felt like it was boring. So I wanted to challenge myself to make another one that was about something I found really fun. I decided to choose the Rubik's Cube. Although I made some of this a few months ago and passed all the tests back then, I decide to offically complete and resubmit. Because I passed the tests, I have been putting it off as if it is finished, and that has really bothered me.

#### **Next Steps:**

* make new images to enhance the instruction sections at the end (and therefore fixing broken image links)

### Day 6: Friday, March 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my new Survey Form because for some reason I thought I was done with the Tribute Page (it was a long day). I looked back at the Tribute Page to recall how to include the favicon and realized I hadn't finished. In the hour that I coded, I was able to complete the following:

* Survey Form: 
    - pass 11 out of 17 tests with simple HTML tags and ids.
    - added a desktop favicon.
    - organize notes for styling that I want to add.
* Tribute Page:
    - update the favicon to a little Rubik's Cube.

#### **Thoughts:**

I tried to code this out as fast as possible and focus more time on styling because that's a skill I feel I am lacking.

#### **Next Steps:**

* For the Tribute Page, I'd like to actually make new images to enhance the instruction sections at the end (and therefore fixing broken image links).
* For the Survey Form, I'd like to complete the styling. I think it might take me a little longer than an hour, but I want to be ambitious because tomorrow is Saturday!
