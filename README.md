### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my new Tribute Page. I was able to complete the following:
* update the organization using Bootstrap classes more efficiently
* renaming h4 elements so that they break down sections more clearly to the reader

#### **Thoughts:**

I had submitted another one for freeCodeCamp in the past, but I felt like it was boring. So I wanted to challenge myself to make another one that was about something I found really fun. I decided to choose the Rubik's Cube. Although I made some of this a few months ago and passed all the tests back then, I decide to offically complete and resubmit. Because I passed the tests, I have been putting it off as if it is finished, and that has really bothered me.

#### **Next Steps:**

* make new images to enhance the instruction sections at the end (and therefore fixing broken image links)
