### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my new Tribute Page. I was able to complete the following:
* update the organization using Bootstrap classes more efficiently.
* renaming h4 elements so that they break down sections more clearly to the reader.

#### **Thoughts:**

I had submitted another one for freeCodeCamp in the past, but I felt like it was boring. So I wanted to challenge myself to make another one that was about something I found really fun. I decided to choose the Rubik's Cube. Although I made some of this a few months ago and passed all the tests back then, I decide to offically complete and resubmit. Because I passed the tests, I have been putting it off as if it is finished, and that has really bothered me.

[fCC: Tribute Page](https://kathleengraham.github.io/fccTributePage/)

#### **Next Steps:**

* make new images to enhance the instruction sections at the end (and therefore fixing broken image links)

<br>

### Day 6: Friday, March 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my new Survey Form because for some reason I thought I was done with the Tribute Page (it was a long day). I looked back at the Tribute Page to recall how to include the favicon and realized I hadn't finished. In the hour that I coded, I was able to complete the following:

* Survey Form: 
    - pass 11 out of 17 tests with simple HTML tags and ids.
    - added a desktop favicon.
    - organize notes for styling that I want to add.
* Tribute Page:
    - update the favicon to a little Rubik's Cube.

#### **Thoughts:**

I tried to code this out as fast as possible and focus more time on styling because that's a skill I feel I am lacking.

#### **Next Steps:**

* For the Tribute Page, I'd like to actually make new images to enhance the instruction sections at the end (and therefore fixing broken image links).
* For the Survey Form, I'd like to complete the styling. I think it might take me a little longer than an hour, but I want to be ambitious because tomorrow is Saturday!

### Day 7: Saturday, March 28, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I did not work on what I thought I would yesterday, but it turns out, it was the right move. My dad is in the process of making a Bible Reader and Tracker app in C# and he wants to turn it into a web app. So I worked on making the web design portions of this. It was great practice for some of the responsive web design projects that I want to complete during this rounds of 100 Days of Code.

#### **Thoughts:**

This has also made me really want to learn C# finally! Great inspiration!

#### **Next Steps:**

Tomorrow I will have our fCC Chicago Study Group meetup online, so I will be working on that project from 1-5 pm CST. Yay!

<br>

### Day 8: Sunday, March 29, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

* Created a Random Advice Generator
* Taught someone how to create an SSH key and how to install, set up, and use Git.
* Updated a little bit of the design to the app my Dad and I are working on together.

#### **Thoughts:**

I absolutely love freeCodeCamp Chicago Study Group. I appreciate that we get to meet online during COVID-19-US. I am really excited to continue more projects like we did today, but I'm even more excited that we've grown a lot recently with more and more newcomers learning to code. Woohoo!

#### **Next Steps:**

I worked on our freeCodeCamp Chicago Study Group idea of a "Random Advice Generator". It was fun! I got some good CSS practice which made me realize I really should plan for the next week to include some more work on Responsive Web Design projects I've been neglecting.

<br>

### Day 9: Monday, March 30, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on my dad's app and I had a lot of fun with the language features he wanted to create. We were able to fix the errors in Spanish characters that were causing the reader to say the words incorrectly.

#### **Thoughts:**

Feeling incredibly thankful to be in tech now and to get the opportunity to spend so much time with my dad on this project. I can tell he is having just as much fun talking about it and working on it with me, too.

#### **Next Steps:**

* get together later in the week so that I can work more on my web design challenges

<br>

### Day 10: Wednesday, April 1, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

* JavaScript lessons on fCC

#### **Thoughts:**

I skipped a day because of some personal things that came up and were a bit challenging. Then today, my mood really affected my creativity. Instead of giving up and skipping another day, I decided that JavaScript practice would be an excellent way of spending my hour of code for the day. Surprisingly, it helped give my brain a break from all the crap that was going on.

#### **Next Steps:**

* Make progress on my Tribute Page - seriously!

<br>

### Day 11: Thursday, April 2, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

DANG! I worked for a few hours on the design for my Tribute Page. I resdesigned parts of it because I really didn't like how it was. I also created more images for the cube examples.

#### **Thoughts:**

I forgot to push my code every once and a while for certain fixes I was working on. That was also because I was adjusting so many different sections, I wasn't even thinking about pushing to GitHub until I had a stopping point for the day.

#### **Next Steps:**

* Adjust the media queries so that the page has the right format on mobile.
* Complete the next fCC Survey Form that I began the other day.
* Continue to work on my Dad's app.
